## ✅ Features

- Static, responsive HTML page
- Clean and minimal CSS layout
- Easy to extend or convert into a component-based app

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- HTML5
- CSS3

(No build tools are required — this is a purely static project.)

## ⚙️ Prerequisites

- A modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari)
- Optional: VS Code (recommended) and the Live Server extension for a local development server
- Optional: Node.js (for using `npx live-server` or adding build tooling later)

## 🚀 Quick Start

Open the project locally in your browser — two simple ways:

1) Open `index.html` directly

- In File Explorer / Finder: double-click `index.html` to open in the default browser
- From PowerShell (Windows):

  ```powershell
  ii .\index.html
  ```

2) Run a simple local server (recommended during development)

- Using VS Code Live Server extension: Right-click `index.html` → "Open with Live Server"
- Using `npx` (no install required):

  ```powershell
  npx live-server
  ```

This will serve the project at `http://127.0.0.1:8080` (port may vary).

## 🧩 Development Workflow

- Clone the repo
- Edit `index.html` and `styles.css` as needed
- Use Live Server to check visual changes instantly
- Keep commits small and descriptive

Recommended Git workflow:

- Create a branch for each feature or fix: `git checkout -b feat/header-improvement`
- Commit changes: `git commit -m "Add ..."`
- Open a Pull Request (PR) for review

## 📁 Project Structure

```
DIT_result/
├─ index.html        # Main HTML page
├─ styles.css        # Main stylesheet
├─ README.md         # (this file)
```

> Tip: If you add more assets (images, scripts), create `assets/`, `css/` or `js/` folders and update this README.

## 🎨 Styling & Conventions

- All styles live in `styles.css` for now
- Use semantic HTML tags (`header`, `main`, `section`, `footer`) for structure and accessibility
- Keep CSS modular and well-commented as the project grows
- Consider adopting a naming convention (BEM, for example) when the stylesheet grows

## ♿ Accessibility

- Use semantic elements and ARIA attributes where appropriate
- Provide `alt` text for all images
- Ensure sufficient color contrast for text and UI elements
- Test keyboard navigation and focus states in the page

## ✅ Testing

This project does not include an automated test suite yet. Recommended manual tests:

- Cross-browser visual checks (Chrome, Firefox, Edge)
- Responsive checks using browser devtools (mobile, tablet, desktop breakpoints)
- Accessibility checks (tab navigation, screen reader smoke test)

If you want to add automated tests later, consider:

- Using a visual regression tool (Percy, Chromatic)
- Adding a11y checks (axe, pa11y)

## 📦 Deployment

Options for deploying this static site:

- GitHub Pages
  - Push to `main` (or `gh-pages`) and enable Pages in repository `Settings → Pages`
  - Serve from `/ (root)` or `/docs` depending on your branch/folder choice
- Static hosts like Netlify or Vercel (drag & drop or link to the GitHub repo)

## 🤝 Contributing

Contributions are welcome! Please follow these steps:

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a feature branch: `git checkout -b feat/your-feature`
3. Commit your changes with clear messages
4. Open a Pull Request describing your changes and rationale

Guidelines:

- Keep changes focused and small
- Add documentation updates when you change UI or behavior
- Write descriptive PR titles and explanations

## 🐞 Troubleshooting

- If assets are not loading, verify the file paths (case-sensitive on some hosts)
- If the Live Server port is in use, try a different port: `npx live-server --port=9000`

If you'd like, I can also:
- Add a sample `LICENSE` file (MIT)
- Add a basic `CONTRIBUTING.md` and `CHANGELOG.md` templates
- Add a simple `package.json` with a `dev` script to launch `live-server`
